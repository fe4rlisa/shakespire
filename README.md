# Shakespire

Shakespire was a boardgame I made with a freind for an english project that I decided would be fun to remake in godot. This is my first time trying to make a game in godot and I still have a lot to work on for this project. 

## Description

Shakespire is a 6 player turn-based board game based off of Hamlet. Players attempt to complete tasks based on their character from the play while trying to manage their sanity level. During each players turn they are able to traverse the map, scout out rooms for items, and place either gift or trap tiles for the other players.

## Current state

* Hexagon tile system
* Hexagon grid map editor 
* Random map arrangement (WIP)
* Color pallette limiter shader



As of right now there aren't many features implemented yet and no demo gameplay.
